[DURATION="00:00"]
[SPEAKER="Jake (they/them)"]
[SUBTITLE="For my final project this fall 2024"]

[DURATION="00:04"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="I will be presenting a miniproject based on Silvia Federici's \"Wages Against Housework.\""]

[DURATION="00:10"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Federici seems to be pushing for a radical, political, and systematic change for how housework and women’s labor is viewed."]

[DURATION="00:18"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="That’s a really daunting project and I’m not like a super social person so I don’t feel like I have the skillset required to contribute to her project in any meaningful way,"]

[DURATION="00:28"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="but at the same time, I don’t want to sit around and wait for other people to enact social change and solve social problems."]

[DURATION="00:37"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="For this podcast, I want to explore some things that people can do in their individual households"]

[DURATION="00:43"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="and within small communities to compliment the larger ideas in Federici’s social project,"]

[DURATION="00:50"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="you know, even if we’re not able to contribute in the big and grand ways. "]

[DURATION="00:55"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Joining me as a special guest is Patty, a fellow classmate in Philosophy and Feminism this fall."]

[DURATION="01:02"]
[SPEAKER="Patty (she/her)"]
[SUBTITLE="That's a great question to ask because this is something I think about a lot myself because yeah, I read a lot of things about like"]

[DURATION="01:11"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="social justice and social change, things that I'm so on board with."]

[DURATION="01:15"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="But a lot of these things, they feel big and grand. And I don't know what I can do"]

[DURATION="01:21"]
[SPEAKER="P]
[SUBTITLE="to actually help in any of these things, you know,"]

[DURATION="01:24"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Right."] 

[DURATION="01:26"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="with unpaid labor, it's difficult, because it's like a lot of the things are perhaps,"]

[DURATION="01:37"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="you know, maybe paying more attention to like local elections and things like that may be helpful."]

[DURATION="01:44"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="But a lot of change can happen, but it's slow change and it's not always evident."]

[DURATION="01:51"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="But just in our interpersonal relationships."] 

[DURATION="01:53"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="I guess learning like learning how to communicate and listen like a little bit better perhaps,"]

[DURATION="01:57"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE=" learning to like stand up for ourselves and not stay in positions like"]

[DURATION="02:01"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="that are… subjectifying us."]

[DURATION="02:04"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Right"]

[DURATION="02:05"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="I mean, as Federici points out too, it's like, this work is often"]

[DURATION="02:10"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="based on coercion, right?"]

[DURATION="02:12"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Right, and there’s like this whole system of coercion instilled from like"]

[DURATION="02:17"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="basically the time you were born, and everyone around you in complicit in this coercion,"]

[DURATION="02:24"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="regardless of if they’re a man, a woman, or otherwise."]

[DURATION="02:28"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="and I think a not-insignificant part of this is"]

[DURATION="02:32"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="women telling each other that if you don’t keep a clean household, that reflects poorly on you and stuff like that."]

[DURATION="02:38"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="Women judging each other!"]

[DURATION="02:41"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="And there was this philosopher, from the 1600 and 1700s, Mary Astell, who like wrote about feminism,"]

[DURATION="02:51"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="and one of the things that she talked about was how"] 

[DURATION="02:54"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="women who weren’t clued-in on it perpetuated sexist standards in their lives."]

[DURATION="03:00"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="Yeah, absolutely. Well, and I mean, I think with a lot of topics that we've talked about in feminism"] 

[DURATION="03:05"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="this semester, it's a lot of like it's a lot of kind of having to do a lot of internal work, on your own,"]

[DURATION="03:12"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="and then go out and live in a society that is very much"]

[DURATION="03:17"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="not interested in doing the same type of internal work"]

[DURATION="03:21"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="and then continuing these oppressive structures,"]

[DURATION="03:25"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="and lie, it's so hard to like not just get sucked back into that"] 

[DURATION="03:30"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="because it's like, what do you do?"]

[DURATION="01:50"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="A point that Federici makes in her piece is how people who exist in a communal living structure, outside a nuclear family, or in queer relationships"]

[DURATION="01:55"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="can temporarily escape some of the trappings of the traditional nuclear family of a husband going to work"]

[DURATION="02:00"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="and a wife doing all the housework regardless of if they also have a job outside the home."]

[DURATION="02:05"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="I think something that we can learn from these other ways of living is how they make the invisible visible in what people consider the standard way to do things."]

[DURATION="02:10"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="People tend to fall into the rhythms of their childhood, and it takes a shift in perspective in order for people to stop perpetuating the ideas of their childhood."]

[DURATION="02:15"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Situations like communal living and queer families bring to light just how much labor is required to maintain a household, right?"]

[DURATION="02:20"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="You know, somebody has to do the dishes, somebody has to vacuum. It's not like we can just sweep that under the rug."]

[DURATION="02:25"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="And I feel like a lot of times when we say, oh, when women get jobs, you have two income households, then you just kind of forget that there's housework that still needs to be done."]

[DURATION="02:30"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="There needs to be communication about who does what."]

[DURATION="02:35"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="In Maria Lugones’s piece about \“world\”-traveling to other people’s internal worlds, and how being raised within a certain culture makes certain mindsets feel \“natural,\” and it took a change,"]

[DURATION="02:40"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="in her case, immigration to the US, for her to realize that those viewpoints weren’t natural and other viewpoints can exist."]

[DURATION="02:45"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="I really like that you brought up the Lugones piece because of like her reaction to her mother being a caregiver and fulfilling that role,"]

[DURATION="02:50"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="kind of, and her distaste for that, not wanting to be that and I definitely identified with that."]

[DURATION="02:55"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="You know, my mom was a homemaker and it was just like, I just, I can't be that. I can't be that, you know?"]

[DURATION="03:00"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="Because I wanted to be my own person, her whole being was erased."]

[DURATION="03:03"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Yeah."]

[DURATION="03:05"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="With regard to like with a kind of divvying up household responsibilities I think, like, you know,"]

[DURATION="03:10"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="my dad would classically, he would always be like, oh, you know, ask my mom if she needed help and then, you know, not help him himself, but like enlist us,"]

[DURATION="03:15"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="rather, you know, and then just sit around, still. So, it's just like extensions of like his kingdom, you know what I mean?"]

[DURATION="03:20"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="P:So it's like challenging that narrative by like making sure everyone is engaged."]

[DURATION="03:24"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Exactly."]

[DURATION="03:30"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="P: But part of that is like picking the right partners, right?"]

[DURATION="03:40"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Right."]

[DURATION="03:50"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Federici puts this strong emphasis on wages and putting monetary value to housework, especially in her COVID-19-era piece."]

[DURATION="04:00"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="And I’ve been musing about my current living situation and how we divvy up household tasks."]

[DURATION="04:10"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="I live in a queer household. It’s communal, we’re college students. I was thinking about how we had structured our housework division,"]

[DURATION="04:20"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="and mixing it with Federici’s monetary value idea. Even though there might not be money that can be spared because budgets are tight, inflation is insane,"]

[DURATION="04:30"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="and a household alone can’t sway the government to start paying for housework, we can still apply a theoretical monetary value to household work "] 

[DURATION="04:40"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="and that makes things visible, makes labor visible."] 

[DURATION="04:50"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Now, I can say I spent 20 minutes vacuuming the house this week, and someone else can say they spent 20 minutes cleaning up the bathroom."] 

[DURATION="05:00"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Reframing this as work with pay comes with conventions like mandatory breaks and doing other tasks that are for your relaxation and not just spend all your time on housework."] 

[DURATION="05:10"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Even without real money, we can still, between partners and household members, make the work they do visible and more fair."] 

[DURATION="05:20"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="Right."] 

[DURATION="05:30"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Obviously, this requires a lot of communication, which…"] 

[DURATION="05:40"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. I mean, the thing is like, how do you put, how can you put a value on unpaid labor like to start."] 

[DURATION="05:50"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="Maybe there's a formula, there's people that are much smarter than me that they could probably figure this out, but I think a step in the right direction is doing what you're saying, right?"] 

[DURATION="06:00"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="It’s like, in these interpersonal relationships, like having respect for one another, having respect for one another's time,"] 

[DURATION="06:10"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="and putting in the same amount of effort, right?"] 

[DURATION="06:20"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="And like weighing that out however it feels fair to that community. That's the right way forward, regardless if we can figure out the unpaid labor part in a government structure."] 

[DURATION="06:30"]
[SPEAKER="P"]
[SUBTITLE="I think that part is just like making sure people have resources so that they're not able to be like, so they're not coercible, right?"] 

[DURATION="06:40"]
[SPEAKER="J"]
[SUBTITLE="Right, like empower people to be able to negotiate with their partners about who’s responsible for what in the household."] 

Sometimes you feel like you're being overburdened with a task because the other people thought it was better to leave you alone. There was this piece in Good Housekeeping about this, where somebody who was talking about how when her husband gets up in the morning to go to work, he would leave all the dishes out and like everything is a mess. The counter is just like a disaster when he leaves. And she was so resentful. And she was like, “how could he like not… does he like not see the mess?”
P: Yeah.
J: And then when she actually had the conversation with him, he was like, “I didn't want to make a huge ruckus. I didn't want to wake you and the kids. I didn't realize this was bothering you so much, I was trying to be quiet in the morning and like not bother you.” And so, after this conversation, the author of the piece, Gemma Hartley, she says sometimes she gets woken up in the morning because her husband is cleaning up after himself but then she falls back asleep, satisfied knowing that like they had this conversation, they understand what's important to each other.
J: And it works better, right? The communication part is really important. 
P: I love that. Yes. But that's an excellent example. And it reminds me a lot of like Thich Nhat Hahn and how he talks about like loving people and like part of like really loving people is like listening to them and also like being able to communicate your needs without like attacking people, right? Just, you should be able to communicate things that are bothering you, and we have the receptivity also on the other end to be able to hear things that may be bothering your partner or your community. That’s such a sweet story! 
J: Yeah, I thought so too.
P: But yeah, it also highlights this thing of like, you know, people don't know things are bothering you unless you tell them. I mean, the thing with that story that you said is like he in his calculation, he was doing the most loving thing, you know? So, it was just a matter of like having that conversation and her being like, “oh, actually the most loving action in my mind is you'd actually cleaning the dishes,” and a lot of these things are just like misunderstandings of like us trying to like read the other person's mind or something like that. When we in fact cannot do that. I wish I could. Maybe I don't, you know.
P: Our families are kind of like microcosms of society, I really feel. And like our interpersonal relationships are microcosms of like what happens on a larger scale.
J:  Yeah.
P: As we see with like patriarchy in the family and patriarchy like on a larger scale, and so it's like if we can't attack it from the larger scale than yeah like doing things like she's talking about like community organization. That kind of starts in the family. We learn to communicate with one another in the family and then take that out into the community, right? And we say, hey, like with our neighbors that we live around, you know, connecting with them and listening to them, because things are going to come up when you start talking to other people.
J: Exactly.  I know that in my household, I was really falling behind on one of my chores. Like, it was just not working. I chose this, but after living with this group for a while, I’m just finding that I keep falling behind. I’m just not interested in doing this task. I also noticed that someone else in the household seems to be having the same problem as I am with a different chore, and like half the time we’re doing each other’s tasks, and I was finding that I didn’t mind doing the other chore, so I decided to open this dialogue. I was like, why don’t we switch, and now we have, and it’s only been a few days, but I’m liking this much better already, and some things in the household have to be done and now they’re being done.  And I think that’s really important, the ability to say like this isn’t working, let’s change it. 
P: Yeah. That's an excellent example of really being honest with ourselves, right? And then being able to communicate that, right? Like, yeah, realizing when things are not working.  I mean, we have a whole system where it's just not working, right? It's like, how do you change that? Well, we can't immediately change it, but we could start with little things. 
J: Yeah, like there’s a huge importance to be made about the fact that we can put words to the concept of unwaged housework, that we have the language to try to tackle it, because I feel like one of the main points of Federici’s piece on waging against housework is giving visibility.  The language and the economics of it is in service of making it visible, because we can’t fix this problem if we don’t know it exists.  
P: Yeah, this kind of idea of like this, it's almost connected to like hermeneutic injustices, right? Like having a language to even say that there is like, and the invisibility of unpaid labor. And really reading and listening and talking to others brings that to the light, right? It's like, oh, you are also having this experience. And like Federici's work, right? And so many others, their work on unpaid labor is like getting the message out there and then getting women to read this and be like, oh, wait, I'm not alone like, this is ridiculous and yeah, like having people be in conversation. And then hopefully opening up that conversation you know with others with partners and communities and things like that, in respectful ways.
J: I hope all the listeners had as much fun as Patty and I did talking about how we can reformat the Wages Against Housework project for a more intimate setting for those of us who aren’t super into going into big crowds of people and doing the large political movements that are required for making huge political systemic change. Maybe we can make small differences slowly within our bubbles that can overtime lead to revolutionary change.
